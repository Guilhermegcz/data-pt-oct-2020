Here are references for learning how to create games in python:

Some advices:

Every game from Pong to Fortnite uses a game loop to control gameplay. The game loop does three very important things:

Expects the user to input something: press a key, click a button, etc.
Updates the state of the game. Given the user input, update the state of the game.
Updates the display and audio output. This can be as simple as a print() statement or an image as  in pygame
For example, if we were to develop the game called Simon Says, its pseudocode (the simple diagram of the code) would be something like:

create an empty list of numbers to store
while the user not quit and the user not wrong:
generate a random number from 1 to 4.
append that random number at the end of the list to store the numbers.
show that list of numbers to the user.
asks: what did simon say?
let the user input what number he thinks Simon said.
if the user has input the numbers in the correct order, continue with the next round
As you can see, a game need not to be so complex. You can start with a simple algorithm and then enhance its displays if you want.

Deliverables

The link to the github folder were the jupyter notebook with your game is

You have to use at least one function

You can use classes if you want a challenge but you don't have to

Presentation 

The presentation will happen at 10 on the next Saturday(14/11/2020) you will have 3-5 minutes to show your game

Afterwords one of your coleagues will review your code and give feedbacks
